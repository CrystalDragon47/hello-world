# hello-world

Hello to you all!

Umm.. So it has been always my dream to do coding, and to make the best Discord bot ever.
I always looked at other Discord bots and wonder how other people made them.. I enjoy drawing and playing some violin when i'm alone. I tend to get inspired by the tiniest things. Like a blade of grass, even a peanut! 
I love to write poems, since poetry is the only form of writing i find quite fitting to describe my feelings, same goes with music! Music is beautiful.. Don't you think?
