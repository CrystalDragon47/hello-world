# hello-world

Hello to you all!

This is Crystal Dragon! I'm a dragon that is.. Made of.. You know, my name is quite self explanatory now isn't it?
I enjoy drawing and playing my violin when i'm alone. I am know to get inspiried by the tiniest things. Like a blade of grass, even a peanut!
I love to write poems, since poetry is the only form of writing i find quite fitting to describe my feelings, same goes with music! Music is beautiful.. Don't you think?
